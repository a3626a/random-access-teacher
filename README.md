_Are you still walking the alphabetical tightrope by chanting A-B-C like it's your first day of kindergarten?_  
**Random Access Teacher** is here to blow your mind (or at least tickle it) with adaptive alphabet quizzing. ðŸŽ‰

## What the Heck is This?

We know the alphabet is old news, but can you instantly tell us which number "Q" is in the lineup? No? That's where we step in.

We apply a top-secret "epsilon-greedy" method. Translation: if you struggle with certain letters, they'll keep popping up until you finally learn them. If youâ€™re already a master of "A", we wonâ€™t waste your time repeating itâ€”much.
  

## How Long Will This Take?

It took me about **30 minutes** to get my lightning-fast alphabetical reflexes up to speed using this tool. Think you can beat that time? Give it a shotâ€”you might surprise yourself. Before you know it, youâ€™ll be rattling off letter positions like a pro.
